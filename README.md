üõ†Ô∏è How to Run Locally
To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  * npm (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

    *(Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub details.)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Or using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables (Crucial\!):**
    This project uses the OMDb API, which requires an API key. To keep your key secure, use environment variables:

      * **Get your API Key:** Obtain a free API key from [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).
      * **Create `.env.local`:** In the **root directory** of your project, create a file named `.env.local`.
      * **Add your API key:**
        ```
        REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_OMDB_API_KEY
        ```
        *(Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_OMDB_API_KEY` with your key. No spaces around `=`, no quotes.)*
      * **Add to `.gitignore`:** Ensure `.env.local` is added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing your key:
        ```
        # .gitignore
        .env.local
        ```

### Running the Application

After installing dependencies and setting up the environment variable, you can start the development server:

Using npm:

```bash
npm start
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
